# KNN implementation in Python.

Algorithm parameters  
K parameter has been chosen to be the square root of the dataset size round down to the nearest odd number.
Eucledean metric has been used as distance measurment.

Testing  
It's been included test in main.py which apply the algorithm on Iris dataset.
The test  normalize all features and after that predict 3 samples.
